Some of the assets I created were the app logo, background art, buttons, menus, & game-level UI. As of today, the game is still in the prototype state."

As the final one, this project aimed for every participant to implement everything taught for four months in the Bootcamp. The deadline to finish the project was only a month.

I chose the book & reference type of app with the theme of endangered plants because I'm into plants & flora so much. I took the plant information from the Wikipedia site. I named the app \"Inviora,\" a combination between \"invisible\" & \"flora.\" The app development only took two weeks, between July & August 2022. The app evaluation process was on August 5th, 2022, and resulted in a perfect score of 5/5 stars. Later on, the app is available to the public."
