This project was deeply memorable because it was the first project where I had to collaborate with new people other than my college friends. I worked in a team of seven with two web stacks: front-end & back-end. The front-end development utilized React as the library, while the back-end used Go programming language.\nThis project was a part of front-end web projects in the Rungguru Bootcamp program. As the final one, this project aimed for every participant to implement everything taught for four months in the Bootcamp. The deadline to finish the project was only a month. Unfortunately, the project has not yet been completed due to time limitations. However, there were still some website components that had been developed & these components are available to view in the gallery below."

I chose the book & reference type of app with the theme of endangered plants because I'm into plants & flora so much. I took the plant information from the Wikipedia site. I named the app \"Inviora,\" a combination between \"invisible\" & \"flora.\" The app development only took two weeks, between July & August 2022. The app evaluation process was on August 5th, 2022, and resulted in a perfect score of 5/5 stars. Later on, the app is available to the public."

Thanks to my mentor's guide & free courses available on the internet, I successfully delivered 7 out of 11 core front-end pages. Unfortunately, I couldn't continue my contribution to the app because my contract was over & I couldn't extend it due to the college priority. I'm eternally grateful for everything I've experienced in this company & project."
