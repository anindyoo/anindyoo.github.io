            I&#39;m a front-end-focused web developer from the beloved city of Jakarta, Indonesia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating a website user interface has been my dream since I was still in Junior
            High School. My curiosity in web development sparked a little when I was taught
            about &#39;web&#39; creation using Blogger in a computer lesson in 2014. I painted that
            moment as a startling epiphany of who I have partially become today. My delight
            towards web development reawakened in the late era (mid-2019) of Senior High School
            when a group of students visited my school to promote their universities. One of the
            student groups exhibited a Computer Science major, in which they demonstrated how a
            website is made and how it can affect people&#39;s lives. By that moment, Computer
            Sciencewas LOCKED IN as my major in higher education. Thankfully, I was able to enroll
            at Universitas Negeri Jakarta, of course, studying Computer Science, and was able to
            learn more about web development, especially the front-end aspect of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            And.... yeahh.... mhmm mhmm..... I graduated in March 2024. Since then, I have kept
            burnishing my front-end web development capability by developing several small
            projects. Right now, I&#39;m also open to any freelance or full-time work
            possibilities to make use of my front-end knowledge. So, any form of connection would
            be a blessing to me. Hope we can meet again!
